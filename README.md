# PAIG-Lang
A series of versions for the PAIG language, developed by me during my Programming Languages class at Cal Poly. Each version adds on to the previous. The final language (PAIG) has a parser, interpreter, type-checker, and serializer. It was written in Racket (LISP). 

## What Each Version Contains:
- Version 1: Parser and Interpreter, handles 1-argument functions, closures, primitive operators, and strings
- Version 2: All of v1, but now handles functions with 0 or multiple arguments
- Version 3: All of v2, but now handles values in an environment and allows for higher order functions, as well as a serializer
- Version 4: All of v3, but now with an updated environment that uses bindings, and built in functions for comparing/manipulating strings and numbers. 
- Version 5: All of v4, but now includes a type checker. Also allows for recursive functions.
